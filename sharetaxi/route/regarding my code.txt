The code is trash. I repeat,   the   code    is    trash. 
I copy pasted old code and added the new stuff.
Still got to properly structure it and separate it into files and what not ;_; 
There are prolly a couple variables that have no use there soooo ...

Will fix it tho :) but this is a working version soo have fun~

//DELETE UPDATE
Didn't have any UI to work with so I just placed an input to enter the route_id :(
